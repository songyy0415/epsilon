[![Build Status](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Epsilon is a high-performance graphing calculator operating system. It includes eleven apps that cover the high school mathematics curriculum.

You can try Epsilon straight from your browser in the [online simulator](https://www.numworks.com/simulator/).

## Diving in

We highly recommend you start by reading the [documentation](docs/README.md) for this project. You'll learn how to install the [SDK](docs/build/README.md) and about the overall architecture of Epsilon.

On a simulator or your own calculator, you can build and run your own projects following these documentations:
- A [custom firmware](docs/build/README.md)
- An [external app](external_apps/README.md)
